To build and test the compiler and runtime just run ant.

Note that some of the tests currently fail. See more info in README.tests.

The compiler and runtime may be invoked using the scripts
bin/ceylonc and bin/ceylon:

  bin/ceylonc -sourcepath samples -d build/classes samples/helloworld.ceylon 
  bin/ceylon -cp build/classes helloworld

The -sourcepath argument to the compiler is required in order for
the compiler to figure out each class's full name.  It is
a colon-separated path, much like javac's -sourcepath argument.

Once built, the compiler and runtime live in these jars:

  build/lib/compiler.jar
  build/lib/runtime.jar

If you want to build and run the Ceylon compiler in Eclipse
then please see README.eclipse for setup instructions.
