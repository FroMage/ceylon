To build and test the compiler and runtime just run ant.

Note that some of the tests currently fail.  There is a list
of tests that are expected to fail at the end of README.tests.

The compiler and runtime may be invoked using the scripts
bin/ceylonc and bin/ceylon:

  bin/ceylonc -src samples samples/helloworld.ceylon 
  bin/ceylon -cp samples helloworld

The -src argument to the compiler is required in order for
the compiler to figure out each class's full name.  It is
a colon-separated path, much like the -classpath argument.

Once built, the compiler and runtime live in these jars:

  build/lib/compiler.jar
  build/lib/runtime.jar

There is an Ant task for building Ceylon projects.  It will
compile both Ceylon and Java sources into class files.  Look
in the runtime.classes rule of build.xml to see how it works.

If you want to build and run the Ceylon compiler in Eclipse
then please see README.eclipse for setup instructions.
