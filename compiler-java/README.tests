The compiler regression test harness is the file "bin/compilertest".

You can execute it directly, or by invoking Ant.

Any directory under the top-level directory "test" containing a
file called "expect.out" is a test case.  When a test case is run,
the harness will compile all *.ceylon and *.java files under that
directory and compare the output of the compiler to the contents
of expect.out.  If they are different then the compiler's output
will be saved in a file called "actual.out".

Note that a sneaky way to make a new test is to put the Java and
Ceylon files into a directory with an empty expect.out, then run
the test, then rename actual.out as expect.out.

Individual tests can be run by supplying their paths as arguments:

  bin/compilertest test/extensions/003 test/annotations/001

Groups of tests can be run too.  This command runs all tests under
tests/extensions:

  bin/compilertest test/extensions
  
Running the harness with no arguments will result in every test
being run.

The harness has a single command line option, "-v", which causes
it to be more verbose.
