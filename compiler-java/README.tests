The compiler regression test harness is the file "bin/compilertest".

You can execute it directly, or by invoking Ant.

Any directory under the top-level directory "test" containing a file
called "cmdline" and a file called "expect.out" is a test case.  When
a test case is run, the harness will compile all *.ceylon and *.java
files under that directory, placing the resulting class files in a
directory under "build/test/compiler/".  The command specified in the
"cmdline" file is then executed, and the resulting output is stored in
a file called "actual.out".  If the contents of actual.out match the
contents of expect.out then the test passed.

Note that a sneaky way to make a new test is to put the Java and
Ceylon files into a directory with an empty expect.out, then run
the test, then rename actual.out as expect.out.

Individual tests can be run by supplying their paths as arguments:

  bin/compilertest test/extensions/003 test/annotations/001

Groups of tests can be run too.  This command runs all tests under
tests/extensions:

  bin/compilertest test/extensions
  
Running the harness with no arguments will result in every test
being run.

The harness has a single command line option, "-v", which causes
it to be more verbose.  The option can be specified multiple times,
to further increase verbosity.  So far:

 -v   Prints detailed output when tests do not succeed.
 -vv  As above, but also prints the commands executed by the test
      harness.  Built files are retained, so all commands printed
      this way should be repeatable on the command line.
