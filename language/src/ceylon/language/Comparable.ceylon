doc "The general contract for values whose magnitude can be 
     compared. `Comparable` imposes a total ordering upon
     instances of any type that satisfies the interface.
     The total order of a type must be consistent with the 
     definition of equality for the type. That is, there
     are three mutually exclusive possibilities:
     
     - `x<y`,
     - `x>y`, or
     - `x==y`"
