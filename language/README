The Ceylon language specification.
==================================

Specification
-------------
To build the PDF and HTML specifications,:
- type 'ant' from the root directory

To build just the PDF:
- type 'ant pdf.doc'

Type analyzer
-------------
To run the type analyzer tests:
 - type 'ant test'

The code is stored under src/
The dependencies are under lib/
The Ceylon code of the language module is under languagesrc/
You need also some generated classes:
 - generated in gensrc/
 - by running 'ant clean tree'

Repository
----------
The local repository is created under ~/.ceylon/repo

ant clean.repo - clean local repository
ant publish.language.module - publish ceylon.language module as .template file in the local repo
ant publish.typechecker - publish typechecker jar in the local repo
ant publish - publish both ceylon.language template and type checker jar

Note on the ant build system (UNSTABLE)
---------------------------------------
antlr.parser: generates the parser for the language
              from the Ceylon.g ANTLR grammar file
antlr.tree: generates the parser and typesafe syntax tree
            for the Ceylon.nodes file which contains a 
            specification of the tree structure
