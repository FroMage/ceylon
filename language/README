The Ceylon language specification.
==================================

To build the pdf and html specifications, 
type "ant" from the root directory.

Type system model
-----------------
The code is stored under src/
The dependencies are under lib/
You need also some generated classes:
 - generated in gensrc/
 - by running 'ant clean tree'

Note on the ant build system (UNSTABLE)
---------------------------------------
antlr.parser: generates the parser for the language
antlr.tree: generates the parser for the Ceylon.nodes file hich contains a specification of the tree structure
the typesafe tree is generated from the Ceylon.nodes specification
