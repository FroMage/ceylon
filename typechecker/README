The Ceylon language specification.
==================================

To build the pdf and html specifications, 
type "ant" from the root directory.

Type system model
-----------------
The code is stored under src/
The dependencies are under lib/
You need also some generated classes:
 - generated in gensrc/
 - by running 'ant clean tree'

Repository
----------
The local repository is created under ~/.ceylon/repo

ant clean.repo - clean local repository
ant publish.language.module - publish ceylon.language module as .template file in the local repo
ant publish.typechecker - publish typechecker jar in the local repo
ant publish - publish both ceylon.language template and type checker jar

Note on the ant build system (UNSTABLE)
---------------------------------------
antlr.parser: generates the parser for the language
antlr.tree: generates the parser for the Ceylon.nodes file hich contains a specification of the tree structure
the typesafe tree is generated from the Ceylon.nodes specification
